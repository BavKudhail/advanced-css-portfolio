02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## The Goal

Build and deploy a personal portfolio website from scratch. Apply the core skills learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Upon opening the portfolio the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them should appear on screen.

Upon clicking on the navigation links the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

Project section shows titled imaged of the developers applications.

The first application in the project section should appear larger than the rest.

Upon clicking on the images of the application, that application is then deployed.

Upon resizing the screen, the webpage adapts to the viewport.
